# Computer Graphics Project

## Introduction

> This is the project of the computer graphics academic course `CMPN205` in Cairo University - Faculty of Engineering - Credit Hours System - Communication and Computer program
>
> This project is about implementing a game engine, then using it to create a simple game of our design.

## Learning Outcomes:

*The goals of this project are to learn how to:* 

1. Use buffers to store mesh data. 
2. Use vertex array objects to render meshes. 
3. Change an object's position, rotation and scale via matrices. 
4. Use depth testing, face culling, blending and color/depth masks. 
5. Use textures to draw images. 
6. Use samplers to configure the texture sampling process. 
7. Combine shaders, pipeline states and uniform data into a Material object. 
8. Describe and process a scene using the Entity-Component-System ECS framework. 
9. Implement a forward renderer with support for transparent objects. 
10. Implement a lighting model and support multiple lights of different types. 
11. Use the engine to implement a simple game.
